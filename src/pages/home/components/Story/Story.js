            <p>ArtPugs are extraterrestrial beings from the planet Cyon from the constellation of Pugis Major.<br/>
              They are sophisticated with a deep appreciation for arts.<br/>
              Their main hobby is talking a selfie in front of famous works of art, but they are shy and awkward.<br/>
              Their life's goal is to share Art with the whole universe because they believe that art can be accesible to any being!<br/>
              There are several clans like the Normal skinned clan as well as the Green, Rose and Mac 'n' cheese.<br/>
              Among them there are the ancient necromancer clan, who experimented with Pug magic and lovecraftian literature and the 10 legendary golden haired beasts, which the bards used to praise them about their accomplicements.
